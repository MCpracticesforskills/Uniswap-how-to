        <h3>The Basics of Uniswap, Explained</h3>
        <h4>
            Yes, I realize decentralized finance is scary at first, but once you understand it you will love it. I
            promise.
        </h4>
        <p>
            Okay, so Uniswap is an <b>automated, decentralized</b> liquidity pool. What does that mean? <br>
            Automated means that transactions occur online. Decentralized means the
            liquidity pool <br> is not subject to a central authority. There are no listing fees or listing proccesses.
            <br>
            Traders exchange tokens on a protocol that runs on the Etherium network.
            The beauty of a <br> liquidity pool is anyone can lend their cryptocurrency regardless of credit score, <br>
            financial assets, or other bank-arbitrated
            requirements. In exchange for providing money <br> to a pool, or multiple pools,
            traders earn fees.

        </p>
        <h3>
            How Does Uniswap Work?üß†
        </h3>
        <p>
            First of all, it is important to understand that there are no order books. Liquidity pools use <br>
            smartcontracts called Constant Product Market Maker. (You don't have to know the name of the <br>
            Smart Contract, but it sounds fancy if you want to impress your friends with your decentralized <br>
            finance knowledge). Smartcontracts hold liquidity pools that people trade against. <b>Here are the
                rules:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                liquidity pools are funded by liquidity providers who earn currency from fees

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>ANYONE</b> can be a liquidity provider IF they can deposit two tokens into the pool (either 2 ERC-20
                tokens OR 1ETC
                token+1ERC-20 token) 

            </li>
            <li>
                traders pay a fee to the pool üíµ
            </li>
            <li>
                fees are then distributed to liquidity providers according to their share of the pool (the more somone
                provides, the
                higher percentage he/she earns

            </li>
            <li>
                liquidity pools are usually made up of stablecoins üí≤
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Liquidity Tokensü•á
        </h3>
        <p>
            Liquidity providers get ‚Äúliquidity tokens‚Äù which represent their share of the liquidity pool. <br>Liquidity
            tokens can be
            redeemed for the share they represent in the pool.

        </p>
        <h3>
            Impermanent Lossüòï

        </h3>
        <p>
            Impermanent loss is the opportunity cost of pooling a token that appreciates in price. <br> Traders still
            make money off of
            fees but the value of tokens changes potentially causing<br>
            one to lose money.
